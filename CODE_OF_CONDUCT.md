# Code of Conduct

## My Pledge

I pledge to make participation in this project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

I pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## My Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward others
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by my mistakes, and learning from the experience
- Focusing on what is best not just for myself, but for the overall project

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

I am responsible for clarifying and enforcing these standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that I deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

I have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and also applies when I am officially representing the project in public spaces. Examples of representing the project include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to me at [INSERT CONTACT EMAIL]. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

I am obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
